    5. Solved problems in apropriate directory

## Both PyBank and PyRamen Exercises Have Been Attempted
### PyBank
    - Pretty strait forward
    - Print staments used for debugging purposes are commeted oiut in the final version
    - Text File = FinancialAnalysis.txt

### PyRamen
    - Used the starter file and followed the directions
    - More difficualt trying to follow someone elses logic/design
    - Print staments used for debugging purposes are commeted oiut in the final version
    - Main Block Print Statemets are limited to first 10 records to save time
        - Python can do calcualtions very quickly
        - Printing/displaying text on screen seems to take a very long time (~750k records)
    - Final Report:
        - First using Python aproach that did not work for text file
        - Second using alterate approach that worked for the text file
